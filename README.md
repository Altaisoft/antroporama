# Antroporama

A small article devoted to human evolution: http://antroporama.iolanta.tech, currently in Russian only.

Antroporama is my playground to explore:

* Semantic Web technologies
* And Robert Martin's [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

...with flavor of optional typing provided by Python 3 ecosystem.
